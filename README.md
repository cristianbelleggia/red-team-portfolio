# Red Team Portfolio (starter repo)

This repository is a starter kit to build your ethical red-team portfolio.
It contains case study templates, lab write-ups, detection rule examples, and a small benign log analysis tool.

## Structure
- projects/       -> examples of authorized lab write-ups and projects
- tools/          -> safe automation and analysis utilities
- detection/      -> example rules (Sigma-like) and correlations
- reports/        -> case study and executive report templates
- assets/         -> screenshots, diagrams, documents
- CV.md           -> example technical CV (customize)
- LINKEDIN_BIO.md -> example LinkedIn bio

## How to use
1. Unzip and review the files.
2. Fill `projects/` with your write-ups (authorized labs only).
3. Keep offensive tooling OUT of public repos; only include safe automation or detection code.
4. Use `tools/log_parser.py` as an example of automation for log analysis.

## Ethics & Safety
- Practice only in authorized environments (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, personal labs).
- Do not publish exploits, sensitive data, or real client information.
- Document authorization and scope in your case studies.
